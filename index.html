        <h2>This is my site about all the things I love.<br>
            Maybe you'll like some of these things too.
        </h2>
        <p>This is a really long, and much more detailed description about the contents
            of this website. This website is a showcase of all my projects. It is also
            a website to show off some things that I am interested in. It is my hope
            that you're either already intested in these things as well, or that you'll
            develop an interest in these things as you learn about them. But who knows?
            Maybe you'll never be interested in these things, and that's ok! We all
            have different interests. All in all, this was really just some text to fill
            up a bit of space on the page.
